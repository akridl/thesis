Reqour deployment is done through CI/CD\footnote{Where \textit{D} stands for deployment, not delivery. Hence, the pipeline is fully automatized.} pipeline. The pipeline consists of 2 main parts: Jenkins (during which \textit{reqour} and \textit{reqour-adjuster} \textbf{JARs} are built and published) and GitLab (during which \textit{reqour} and \textit{reqour-adjuster} \textbf{images} are built and published, as well as deployment being done).

All PNC deployment configs are managed as a part of the internal RedHat GitLab instance, hence, not being publicly available. Because of that, only word descriptions together with diagrams will be present in this chapter.

Both Jenkins and GitLab parts are visualized (in less detail) in Figure \ref{fig:pipeline}.
