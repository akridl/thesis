Within the listing \ref{lst:init}, every endpoint is created by \textit{endpoint.validated\_json\_endpoint()}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/project-ncl/repour/blob/akridl-thesis/repour/server/endpoint/endpoint.py##L99}} method, which does (from high-level perspective) the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    %% TODO: say about MDC propagations?
    \item \textbf{Parse JSON input request}\\
    In case parsing fails, 400 is returned to the client right away.

    \item \textbf{Validate parsed request}\\
    Every endpoint provides the valid format which all the incoming requests must meet. In case invalid request is given, 400 is returned.

    \item \textbf{Call the function}\\
    Call the function provided as one of the arguments, which is doing the actual computation.

    \item \textbf{Send the callback}\\
    In case the callback was provided within the request, make the callback. The method handling callback sending is implemented to be resilient by using retries and exponential backoff between fails.

\end{enumerate}
