As was mentioned in \ref{section:pnc}, one of the PNC requirements is the ability to cancel any running build. For this, those PNC microservices that perform long-running operations expose \textit{POST /cancel} endpoint.

Alignment is an example of such a long-running operation during a build, which can be canceled by invoking the \textit{POST /cancel} endpoint.
