To conclude, unlike Repour scaling, Reqour scaling is also (and mainly) horizontal, potentially allowing scaling up to higher number of parallel alignments than Repour does.

In addition, Reqour automatically supports backpressure mechanism: in case it cannot create any new alignment, it will simply wait for some preceding one to finish. In contrast, Repour does not allow such mechanism and a pod simply fails (on OOM error) in case clients are too greedy and want to start too many alignments in parallel.
