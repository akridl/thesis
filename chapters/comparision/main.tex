In Chapter \ref{chap:repour}, we described Repour, i.e., old implementation. In Chapter \ref{chap:reqour}, we looked into Reqour, i.e., new implementation. However, we never really mentioned their differences and did no comparison so far ‚Äê that will be changed in this chapter in which we will specifically focus on the comparison of maintainability, scalability, and clusterability.
