In Chapter \ref{chap:repour}, we described Repour, i.e., old implementation. In Chapter \ref{chap:reqour}, we looked into Reqour, i.e., new implementation. However, we never really mentioned their differences and did no comparision so far ‚Äê that will be changed in this chapter in which we will specifically focus on comparision of maintainability, scalability, and clusterability.

\section{Scalability}

\section{Clusterability}

\section*{Conclusion}
To sum up the whole chapter, we showed that new solution introduced by Reqour should enhance maintainability, scalability, and also clusterability.
