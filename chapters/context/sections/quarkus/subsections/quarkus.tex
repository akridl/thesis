Jakarta EE specification process\footnote{\url{https://jakarta.ee/committees/specification/guide/}} is long-running and formal, which leads to specifications being mature and stable. Although it may not seem so at first glance, this can be quite a limiting disadvantage: typical examples are teams who develop enterprise applications but want to use the latest enterprise standards. Using Jakarta EE, such an integration can take place in a year. This was one of the reasons why Microprofile\footnote{\url{https://microprofile.io/}} got popular. Another one being its specialization in optimizing enterprise Java for a microservices architecture.

From the architectural point of view, Microprofile is built on the same principles as Jakarta EE: consists of specifications and once we use Microprofile API, we have access to the functionality of any of its specifications.

Quarkus is an open-source implementation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus}} of Microprofile API and has a great focus on microservices: "Quarkus is a Java framework that targets microservices and serverless system
development. Quarkus emerged as an alternative to the existing Java
microservices stack to provide an application framework that delivers an
unmatched performance benefits while still providing a development model
utilizing the APIs of popular libraries
and Java standards that the Java ecosystem has been practicing for years."\cite{quarkusinaction}\cite{quarkusBook}.

Documentation is separated as a series of guides\footnote{\url{https://quarkus.io/guides/}}. When describing implementation details later in the text, we will sometimes reference concrete guides from this series.
