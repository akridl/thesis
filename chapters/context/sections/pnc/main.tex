As is clearly described in an IEEE Software article: "Release engineering focuses
on building a pipeline that transforms
source code into an integrated, compiled, packaged, tested, and signed
product that’s ready for release. The
pipeline’s input is the source code developers write to create a product"\cite{releaseEngineeringArticle}. Such release engineers are present in any development team which develops enterprise-ready product. Hence, they are present also in Red Hat Middleware\footnote{\url{https://developers.redhat.com/middleware}} teams. Examples of products from Red Hat Middleware are Quarkus\footnote{\url{https://developers.redhat.com/products/quarkus/overview}} or JBoss EAP\footnote{\url{https://developers.redhat.com/products/eap/overview}}.
