For a while, we even considered to split the adjuster into a separate project. But in case of split, we would need to split rest of the project to a core (containing all the common abstractions) and everything other (which would use the core). Adjuster would in that case use a core as its dependency. This separation would either mean 3 separate projects (which would lead from our considerations to more drawbacks than benefits) or into a project with 2 modules, and a single-module adjuster project. In the end, separating the whole project into 3 modules (adjuster, core, and everything else) seemed as a most suitable solution, which was chosen. These 3 modules, together with their inter-module dependencies, are shown in Figure \ref{fig:reqour-modules}. All 3 modules have separate YAML configurations\footnote{\url{https://quarkus.io/guides/config-yaml}} mapped to Java objects\footnote{\url{https://quarkus.io/guides/config-mappings}}.
