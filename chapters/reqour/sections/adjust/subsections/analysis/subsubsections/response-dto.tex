The response DTO (sents as callback payload) is JSON of the following format\footnote{The format is not valid JSON, since \textit{manipulatorResult} and \textit{callback} object types are hidden. The former because of unnecessary details, and the latter is already present in the cloning response DTO shown in \ref{subsubsec:cloning-response-dto}}:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
{
    "downstreamCommit": "string",
    "tag": "string",
    "upstreamCommit": "string",
    "internalUrl": {
        "readwriteUrl": "string",
        "readonlyUrl": "string"
    },
    "isRefRevisionInternal": boolean,
    "manipulatorResult": { ... },
    "callback": { ... }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Fields have the following meaning:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{downstreamCommit}\\
    Commit with alignment changes made by Reqour.

    \item \textbf{tag}\\
    Tag of the \textbf{downstreamCommit}.

    \item \textbf{upstreamCommit}\\
    Commit from the upstream repository upon which is the alignment being made.
    
    \item \textbf{internalUrl}\\
    Same meaning as in the request DTO.

    \item \textbf{isRefRevisionInternal}\\
    True in case the \textit{ref} from the request DTO is present in the internal repository.

    \item \textbf{manipulatorResult}\\
    Unified format of the result returned from the Reqour.\\
    \textbf{Note:} Manipulators themselves do not return result of the unified format. Hence, it is Reqour's responsibility to unify it.

    \item \textbf{callback}\\
    Same meaning as in the cloning response DTO (see \ref{subsubsec:cloning-response-dto}).
\end{itemize}
