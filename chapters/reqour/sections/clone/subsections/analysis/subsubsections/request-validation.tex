The request DTO is being validated in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{originRepoUrl, targetRepoUrl}\\
    Both fields are validated in the same way as \textit{externalUrl} of translation request, as was described in \ref{subsubsec:translation-request-validation}.

    \item \textbf{taskId, callback}\\
    Same validation takes place as within internal SCM repository creation request (described in \ref{subsubsec:internal-scm-request-validation}).
\end{itemize}
