For logging, we use SLF4J\footnote{\url{https://www.slf4j.org/}}, which is defined in our classes as a static field created by Lombok's \textit{@Slf4j}\footnote{\url{https://projectlombok.org/api/lombok/extern/slf4j/Slf4j}} annotation. SLF4J uses as its logging backend JBoss Log Manager, which is configured by Quarkus by default (and connection to this backend is done through its corresponding adapter \footnote{\url{https://github.com/jboss-logging/slf4j-jboss-logmanager}}).

Since JBoss Log Manager backend supports MDC\footnote{\url{https://javadoc.io/doc/org.jboss.logmanager/jboss-logmanager/latest/org/jboss/logmanager/MDC.html}} (Mapped Diagnostic Context), we set this up (based on HTTP Headers of incoming requests to Reqour) and use to further identify our emitted log events.

We use JSON as the logging format\footnote{\url{https://quarkus.io/guides/logging##json-logging}} (configured automatically when using \textit{quarkus-logging-json} extension).

There are 2 logging handlers: console logging handler printing all the caught log events into a console, and Kafka logging handler provided by \textit{quarkus-logging-kafka}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/project-ncl/quarkus-logging-kafka}} dependency, which sends all the incoming log events into a Kafka topic. Thanks to this, Reqour contributes to logging pipeline and providing so-called \textbf{live-logs} from its part of a build.
