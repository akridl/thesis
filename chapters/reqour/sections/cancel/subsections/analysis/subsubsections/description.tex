One of the requirements of PNC (discussed in \ref{subsubsec:pnc-requirements}) is an ability to cancel running builds. Reqour's alignment operation (introduced in \ref{section:alignment}) is one of the build phases, which can be long-running (exceeding over an hour in some cases). Quite naturally, the alignment operation has to be cancellable in order to meet the cancelling requirement.
